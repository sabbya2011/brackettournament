TournamentBracket Project is created to display a knock tournament progress.

Once a node is clicked it will progress to the next round.

However once a certain competitor's challenger is selected it cannot be undone.

Once the winner of the tournament is choosen there is no way to undo it.

One can reset the tournament at any stage.

To change the name of any competitor select the edit button at down below to go the the Modify Competitor's Name Area.

To modify a name , simply change it and on blur event the change name request will be triggered.
(As of now no validation is there on Username and even if one don't modify the user name and still comes out of the input area, the request will still be triggered.)
